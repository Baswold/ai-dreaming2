# DreamingAI Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Quick Start (Recommended)

### Option 1: Direct Python Execution
```bash
# 1. Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# 2. Download a small model (0.5B parameters)
ollama pull qwen2.5:0.5b

# 3. Run DreamingAI
cd dreaming_ai
python3 dreaming_ai.py

# 4. Choose option "1" to start dreaming
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
cd dreaming_ai
docker-compose up --build

# The system will automatically download the model and start
```

## 🧠 What You'll See

When the AI starts dreaming, you'll see output like:
```
🌙 Starting dreaming session...

💭 [14:23:15] SEED
   consciousness + crystal

💭 [14:23:23] REASONING
   Like a crystal, consciousness might have a structure we can't see...

💡 [14:23:31] REASONING (Score: 0.45)
   What if consciousness forms patterns the way crystals do?

🌟 [14:23:39] GOLD STRIKE (Score: 0.72)
✨ The lattice of awareness - perhaps consciousness isn't produced 
   by the brain but crystallized by it!
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize:
- `dream_interval`: Time between thoughts (seconds)
- `max_thoughts_per_session`: Maximum thoughts per session
- `model`: Which Ollama model to use
- `interest_threshold`: Minimum score for "interesting" thoughts

## 📁 Output Files

The system creates:
- `dreaming_memory.db` - SQLite database of all thoughts
- `dream_outputs/golden_thought_*.md` - Golden discoveries
- `dream_outputs/session_summary_*.md` - Session summaries
- `dream_outputs/dreaming.log` - System logs

## 🎛️ Available Commands

1. **start** - Begin autonomous dreaming session
2. **golden** - View all golden thoughts discovered
3. **quit** - Exit the application

## 🔍 Memory Requirements

- **qwen2.5:0.5b**: ~400MB RAM (recommended)
- **phi3:mini**: ~2GB RAM
- **gemma2:2b**: ~3GB RAM

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Adding Custom Thought Seeds
Edit the `ThoughtSeeder` class to add your own concepts:
```python
self.custom_concepts = [
    "quantum mechanics", "poetry", "mathematics",
    "What if colors had emotions?",
    "How do ideas reproduce?"
]
```

### Adjusting Reasoning Modes
Modify weights in `config.json`:
```json
"reasoning_strategies": {
    "free_association": 0.4,
    "creative_what_if": 0.3,
    "pattern_recognition": 0.2,
    "logical_deduction": 0.1
}
```

## 🎨 Philosophy

DreamingAI embodies pure autonomous thinking:
- **No system prompts** - The AI starts with a blank slate
- **No goals or tasks** - Just pure curiosity-driven exploration
- **Emergent insights** - Discoveries arise naturally from the thinking process
- **Interest-driven** - The AI decides what's worth exploring further

This represents a different paradigm from task-oriented AI - instead of trying to be "useful," it celebrates the intrinsic value of thought and discovery.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Model memory issues**: Use smaller models like `qwen2.5:0.5b`
**Ollama not responding**: Restart with `sudo systemctl restart ollama`
**No interesting thoughts**: Lower `interest_threshold` in config
**Too fast/slow thinking**: Adjust `dream_interval` in config

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

Unlike traditional AI systems that need prompts and goals, DreamingAI:
- Thinks for the pure joy of thinking
- Discovers unexpected connections between concepts
- Develops its own interests over time
- Records breakthrough insights automatically
- Runs completely locally for privacy

The system demonstrates that intelligence can emerge from the process of thinking itself, without external direction or predetermined objectives.
