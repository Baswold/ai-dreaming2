I can see how this could be similar to the calm before a storm. Sunday is usually a day of relaxation and rest, but there might be an event or activity planned for later in the evening that will cause people to stay up later than usual. It's like they're waiting for something exciting to happen, just like how people often anticipate a storm by feeling uneasy or anxious about what's coming. In both cases, there is a sense of anticipation and expectation that things might change suddenly or unexpectedly. What analogy comes to mind?
